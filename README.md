# About me 👋

- 🏫 I'm a fourth-year PhD student at NYU Shanghai and NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I'll be primarily based in Shanghai in the year to come (2024-2025). 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the optimal operation and design of transportation systems with modular vehicles, and some OR topics such as resource allocation.
- 💾 I try to use this Github account to manage the codes for my projects. I hope I can get along well with this.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning ice staking and pencil sketching.
- 📫 How to reach me: yuhao.liu@nyu.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once went skinny-dipping (and I like it).
